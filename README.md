### Project Title
Bikeshare project - data analysis in Python

### Description

The project uses data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. It is using data for three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
The bikeshare.py file is set up to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers below questions about the dataset:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York City, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day? (Yes / No)
3. (If you choose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If you choose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The script provides below statistics:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most popular month
most popular day of week
most popular hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

most popular start station
most popular end station
most popular trip from start to end station

#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)

Also the script is asking the user if raw data should be displayed.
